Step 1: Understand Array Representation

Array Representation in Memory
    Contiguous Memory Allocation: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that all elements of the array are stored in consecutive memory addresses.
    Index-Based Access: Arrays allow constant-time access (O(1)) to elements using an index. This is because the address of any element can be computed directly using the base address and the index.
    Fixed Size: The size of an array is fixed upon creation. To change the size, you would need to create a new array and copy the elements.
    Advantages:
        Fast Access: Direct access to elements via indexing.
        Simplicity: Easy to use and implement for small datasets.
        Memory Efficiency: Low overhead compared to more complex data structures.


Step 2: Setup
Create a class Employee with attributes like employeeId, name, position, and salary.

// Employee.java
public class Employee {
    private String employeeId;
    private String name;
    private String position;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String employeeId, String name, String position, double salary) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String getEmployeeId() {
        return employeeId;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getPosition() {
        return position;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "employeeId='" + employeeId + '\'' +
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", position='" + position + '\'' +
                ", salary=" + salary +
                '}';
    }
}

Step 3: Implementation
Array-Based Employee Management
Use an array to store employee records and implement methods for adding, searching, traversing, and deleting employees.

// EmployeeManagementSystem.java
public class EmployeeManagementSystem {
    private Employee[] employees;
    private int size;

    public EmployeeManagementSystem(int capacity) {
        employees = new Employee[capacity];
        size = 0;
    }

    // Add Employee
    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        if (size < employees.length) {
            employees[size++] = employee;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Array is full. Cannot add more employees.");
        }
    }

    // Search Employee by ID
    public Employee searchEmployeeById(String employeeId) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (employees[i].getEmployeeId().equals(employeeId)) {
                return employees[i];
            }
        }
        return null; // Not found
    }

    // Traverse and Print All Employees
    public void traverseEmployees() {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            System.out.println(employees[i]);
        }
    }

    // Delete Employee by ID
    public void deleteEmployeeById(String employeeId) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (employees[i].getEmployeeId().equals(employeeId)) {
                for (int j = i; j < size - 1; j++) {
                    employees[j] = employees[j + 1];
                }
                employees[--size] = null; // Clear the last element
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Employee not found.");
    }
}

Step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity

1.Add Employee:

    Time Complexity: O(1) for adding at the end of the array, assuming there's space.
    Space Complexity: O(1)

2.Search Employee:

    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of employees, as it requires scanning each element.
    Space Complexity: O(1)

3.Traverse Employees:

    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of employees.
    Space Complexity: O(1)

4.Delete Employee:

    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of employees. Shifting elements takes linear time.
    Space Complexity: O(1)
Limitations of Arrays
    Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, which limits their ability to grow dynamically. If the number of employees exceeds the initial capacity, you would need to create a new, larger array and copy existing data.
    Insertion/Deletion Complexity: Inserting or deleting elements can be inefficient because it may require shifting elements.
    Flexibility: Arrays are not suitable for scenarios where the size of the dataset changes frequently.
When to Use Arrays
    Small to Moderate Datasets: Arrays are efficient for small datasets or when the maximum size is known in advance.
    Static Data: When the dataset size is fixed and does not change, arrays provide a simple and effective solution.
    Performance Requirements: When you need constant-time access to elements and can manage the size constraints.



Example Usage
// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmployeeManagementSystem system = new EmployeeManagementSystem(5);

        // Adding Employees
        system.addEmployee(new Employee("E001", "John Doe", "Developer", 70000));
        system.addEmployee(new Employee("E002", "Jane Smith", "Manager", 90000));
        system.addEmployee(new Employee("E003", "Emily Johnson", "Analyst", 60000));

        // Searching for an Employee
        System.out.println("Search Result: " + system.searchEmployeeById("E002"));

        // Traversing All Employees
        System.out.println("All Employees:");
        system.traverseEmployees();

        // Deleting an Employee
        system.deleteEmployeeById("E003");
        System.out.println("Employees After Deletion:");
        system.traverseEmployees();
    }
}

Output:
Search Result: Employee{employeeId='E002', name='Jane Smith', position='Manager', salary=90000.0}
All Employees:
Employee{employeeId='E001', name='John Doe', position='Developer', salary=70000.0}
Employee{employeeId='E002', name='Jane Smith', position='Manager', salary=90000.0}
Employee{employeeId='E003', name='Emily Johnson', position='Analyst', salary=60000.0}
Employees After Deletion:
Employee{employeeId='E001', name='John Doe', position='Developer', salary=70000.0}
Employee{employeeId='E002', name='Jane Smith', position='Manager', salary=90000.0}

This code demonstrates how to manage employee records using arrays, including adding, searching, traversing, and deleting employees. The implementation highlights both the strengths and limitations of using arrays for such tasks.
