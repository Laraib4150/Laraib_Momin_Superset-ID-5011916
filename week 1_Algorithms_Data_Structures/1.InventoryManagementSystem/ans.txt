Step 1: Understand the Problem
Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms are crucial in managing large inventories for several reasons:

Efficiency: They help in storing and retrieving data quickly, which is essential for real-time inventory management.
Scalability: As the number of products grows, efficient data structures ensure that operations like searching, updating, and deleting remain fast.
Memory Usage: Proper choice of data structures helps in optimizing memory usage, which is important for handling large datasets.


Suitable Data Structures

1.ArrayList:

Advantages: Provides constant-time access to elements by index, and efficient for operations where elements are frequently added or removed from the end.
Disadvantages: Slow for searching and deleting elements by value as it requires linear time complexity.

2.HashMap:

Advantages: Provides constant-time complexity (O(1)) for adding, updating, and retrieving elements if the hash function distributes elements uniformly.
Disadvantages: Consumes more memory due to hashing and might have slower performance if the hash table is resized or if hash collisions occur.

3.TreeMap:

Advantages: Maintains elements in a sorted order and provides logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for add, update, and delete operations.
Disadvantages: Slower compared to HashMap for retrieval operations due to the need to maintain order.


Step 2: Setup
Create a new project named InventoryManagementSystem.

Step 3: Implementation
Define the Product Class

// Product.java
public class Product {
    private String productId;
    private String productName;
    private int quantity;
    private double price;

    public Product(String productId, String productName, int quantity, double price) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.productName = productName;
        this.quantity = quantity;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getProductId() {
        return productId;
    }

    public void setProductId(String productId) {
        this.productId = productId;
    }

    public String getProductName() {
        return productName;
    }

    public void setProductName(String productName) {
        this.productName = productName;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Product{" +
                "productId='" + productId + '\'' +
                ", productName='" + productName + '\'' +
                ", quantity=" + quantity +
                ", price=" + price +
                '}';
    }
}

Choose Data Structure and Implement Methods
We'll use HashMap for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. The key will be productId, and the value will be the Product object.

// InventoryManager.java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class InventoryManager {
    private Map<String, Product> inventory;

    public InventoryManager() {
        inventory = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addProduct(Product product) {
        inventory.put(product.getProductId(), product);
    }

    public void updateProduct(Product product) {
        if (inventory.containsKey(product.getProductId())) {
            inventory.put(product.getProductId(), product);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Product not found.");
        }
    }

    public void deleteProduct(String productId) {
        if (inventory.containsKey(productId)) {
            inventory.remove(productId);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Product not found.");
        }
    }

    public Product getProduct(String productId) {
        return inventory.get(productId);
    }

    public void displayAllProducts() {
        for (Product product : inventory.values()) {
            System.out.println(product);
        }
    }
}

Step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity

1.Add Product:

HashMap: O(1) on average. The time complexity is constant due to direct access using hashing.
ArrayList: O(n) in the worst case if we need to search for a position.

2.Update Product:

HashMap: O(1) on average. Direct access by key allows for quick updates.
ArrayList: O(n) if searching by product ID.

3.Delete Product:

HashMap: O(1) on average. Direct access by key allows for quick deletion.
ArrayList: O(n) if searching by product ID.

Optimization Strategies

1.HashMap:

Ensure a good hash function to minimize collisions and maintain constant-time complexity.
Adjust the initial capacity and load factor to optimize performance based on expected number of entries.

2.Alternative Data Structures:

For large datasets where order matters, consider TreeMap for logarithmic time complexity but note the trade-off in performance.
For scenarios with frequent updates and less frequent lookups, LinkedHashMap can maintain insertion order and provide efficient updates.
