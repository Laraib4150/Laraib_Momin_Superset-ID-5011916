Step 1: Understand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion
Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive algorithm typically has two main components:

Base Case: A condition under which the recursion stops, providing a direct answer.
Recursive Case: The part of the method where the recursion occurs, breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
Advantages: Simplifies the problem-solving process for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems, such as calculating factorials, Fibonacci series, and traversing tree structures.

Disadvantages: Can lead to excessive computation and stack overflow if not implemented with proper base cases and memoization. Inefficient for problems that can be solved iteratively with better performance.

Step 2: Setup
You will create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach. For financial forecasting, assume you want to predict future values based on past growth rates.

Step 3: Implementation
Let's assume you want to predict the future value of an investment based on a growth rate and the number of years into the future. The formula for future value based on compound interest is:

Future Value = Current Value ×(1+Growth Rate)
                             Number of Years

In a recursive approach, you can calculate the future value by multiplying the current value by the growth rate and reducing the number of years each step.

Here’s how you can implement this in Java:

// FinancialForecasting.java
public class FinancialForecasting {

    // Recursive method to calculate future value
    public static double calculateFutureValue(double currentValue, double growthRate, int years) {
        // Base case: No years left, return the current value
        if (years == 0) {
            return currentValue;
        }
        // Recursive case: Calculate future value for one year less
        return calculateFutureValue(currentValue * (1 + growthRate), growthRate, years - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double initialInvestment = 1000.0; // Initial investment
        double annualGrowthRate = 0.05; // 5% growth rate
        int numberOfYears = 10; // Forecast for 10 years

        double futureValue = calculateFutureValue(initialInvestment, annualGrowthRate, numberOfYears);
        System.out.printf("Future Value after %d years: %.2f%n", numberOfYears, futureValue);
    }
}

Output:
Future Value after 10 years: 1628.89

Step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call reduces the number of years by 1 until it reaches 0. This results in n recursive calls.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow for large n.
Optimization
Memoization: Store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. This can turn a recursive solution into an efficient dynamic programming solution.

Iterative Solution: For problems that can be solved with recursion, converting to an iterative solution can be more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. In this case, calculating the future value using a loop avoids the overhead of recursive calls.

Here's an iterative version of the future value calculation:


// FinancialForecastingIterative.java
public class FinancialForecastingIterative {

    public static double calculateFutureValue(double currentValue, double growthRate, int years) {
        double futureValue = currentValue;
        for (int i = 0; i < years; i++) {
            futureValue *= (1 + growthRate);
        }
        return futureValue;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double initialInvestment = 1000.0; // Initial investment
        double annualGrowthRate = 0.05; // 5% growth rate
        int numberOfYears = 10; // Forecast for 10 years

        double futureValue = calculateFutureValue(initialInvestment, annualGrowthRate, numberOfYears);
        System.out.printf("Future Value after %d years: %.2f%n", numberOfYears, futureValue);
    }
}

Output:
Future Value after 10 years: 1628.89

Benefits of the Iterative Approach:
    Time Complexity: O(n), but with less overhead compared to recursion.
    Space Complexity: O(1), as it does not use extra stack space.
