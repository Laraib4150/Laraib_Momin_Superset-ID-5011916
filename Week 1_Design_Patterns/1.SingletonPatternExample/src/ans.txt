Step 1: Create a New Java Project
Let's assume you've created a new Java project named SingletonPatternExample.

Step 2: Define a Singleton Class
Create a class named Logger in your project.

// Logger.java
public class Logger {
    // Private static instance of itself
    private static Logger instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Logger() {
        // Initialize logging settings here if needed
    }

    // Public static method to provide the single instance
    public static Logger getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Logger();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Example method to log messages
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Log message: " + message);
    }
}


Step 3: Implement the Singleton Pattern
The code above already implements the Singleton pattern by ensuring:

The Logger class has a private static instance of itself.
The constructor of Logger is private.
A public static method getInstance() is provided to get the single instance of the Logger class.
Step 4: Test the Singleton Implementation
Create a test class to verify that only one instance of Logger is created and used across the application.

// SingletonPatternExample.java
public class SingletonPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the instance of Logger
        Logger logger1 = Logger.getInstance();
        Logger logger2 = Logger.getInstance();

        // Log messages
        logger1.log("This is the first log message.");
        logger2.log("This is the second log message.");

        // Verify that both logger1 and logger2 are the same instance
        if (logger1 == logger2) {
            System.out.println("logger1 and logger2 are the same instance.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("logger1 and logger2 are different instances.");
        }
    }
}

When you run SingletonPatternExample, you should see:

Output:
Log message: This is the first log message.
Log message: This is the second log message.
logger1 and logger2 are the same instance.

This confirms that the Logger class is correctly following the Singleton design pattern.
